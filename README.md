# Tips-Calculator
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I have created a small application called Tips Calculator using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application is useful and simple, helping users to calculate the total value of a bill, including the percentage of tip they want to leave for the services received.

I have created an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, with input fields for the bill amount, tip percentage, and number of people. The application automatically calculates the total amount of the bill, including the tip percentage, and divides it by the number of people to calculate the amount each person needs to pay.
